My First Desktop Application 🚀 This is my first desktop application, created as part of my learning journey.

📚✨ It is built using Java ☕ and Java Swing 🎨 for the graphical user interface (GUI).

This project helped me explore the fundamentals of desktop application development. 💻🔧

The application was developed without adhering to a specific architectural pattern, such as MVC or layered architecture. 
The focus was on implementing core functionality and delivering the required features efficiently.
